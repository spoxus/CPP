Vectors
A vector is a one-dimensinal list of numbers. When used in mathematical expressions, vectors are usually assumed to be written vertically.
In deep learning, we typically use vectors to represent one sample: one set of features that we we'll input to a model.
But mathematically, vectors are used to represent points in space.
