Updates:

    page 84: the URL for the Iris dataset has changed:
                https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/

    Tensorflow issues addressable with:
                pip3 install tensorflow-cpu  (TF 2.8)
                then update repo code to move 'keras' imports to 'tensorflow.keras'
